##  How to Use This Resource

1.  **Find the Platform:** Navigate to the specific repository for the platform you are interested in (e.g., `leetcode-solutions` or `codeforces-contests`).
2.  **Browse by Category/Contest:** Look for folders organized by problem category, contest number, or difficulty rating.
3.  **Review the Code:** Solutions are generally named based on the problem title. Inside, you'll find the code and often a brief explanation or link to the problem statement.
4.  **Learn:** Don't just copy! Review the logic, understand the chosen **Data Structure** or **Algorithm**, and try to implement it yourself.

## Contribution Guidelines (We Need Your Help!)

This project thrives on community effort! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork** the specific repository you want to contribute to.
2.  **Create a New Branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-problem-name`).
3.  **Add Your Solution:**
    * Create a folder structure that matches the existing pattern (e.g., `Platform/ProblemSet/ProblemName/solution.cpp`).
    * Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and includes a brief header with the problem source.
4.  **Commit Your Changes** (`git commit -m "feat: Add solution for [Platform] [Problem Name]"`).
5.  **Push to the Branch** and open a **Pull Request (PR)** against the `main` branch of this organization.

> **Note:** Please ensure your solution is efficient and follows best practices for the language used.
